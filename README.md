# vista-move-engine-stack

`vista-move-engine-stack` packages a practical chess and game engines exercise in Elixir. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Vista Move Engine Stack

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Problem Shape

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Repository Map

- `lib`: library code
- `test`: language test directory
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Main Behaviors

- Includes extended examples for turn flow, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents search limits tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Internal Model

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps position state, move ranking, and turn flow in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 174, with risk penalty 5, latency penalty 2, and weight bonus 2. The Elixir project uses Mix and ExUnit with clear data maps for each scenario.

## Run It Locally

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Scenario Walkthrough

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more chess and game engines fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Known Edges

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.
